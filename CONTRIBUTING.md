## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Changes

### .upptimerc.yml Structure

```yaml
# Main configuration sections:
sites:           # Services to monitor
status-website:  # Status page configuration  
workflowSchedule: # Monitoring frequency
notifications:   # Alert configurations
```

### Best Practices

1. **Validate URLs**: Ensure all monitored URLs are accessible
2. **Set Appropriate Timeouts**: Consider service response characteristics
3. **Use Descriptive Names**: Clear service identification
4. **Group Related Services**: Logical organization of services
5. **Document Changes**: Clear commit messages and PR descriptions

### Testing Changes

Before submitting configuration changes:

1. **Syntax Validation**: Ensure YAML is properly formatted
2. **URL Accessibility**: Verify all URLs are reachable
