# Incident Response Playbook

This playbook provides step-by-step procedures for responding to service incidents detected by the Sakneen Status Monitor.

## üö® Incident Classification

### Severity Levels

| Level | Description | Response Time | Escalation |
|-------|-------------|---------------|------------|
| **P0 - Critical** | Complete service outage affecting customers | Immediate (0-5 min) | Executive team |
| **P1 - High** | Partial outage or severe performance degradation | 15 minutes | Engineering leads |
| **P2 - Medium** | Minor performance issues or single service impact | 1 hour | On-call engineer |
| **P3 - Low** | Monitoring alerts or minor issues | 4 hours | Next business day |

## üìã Initial Response Checklist

### Immediate Actions (0-5 minutes)

- [ ] **Acknowledge the alert** in monitoring system
- [ ] **Verify the incident** by checking multiple sources
- [ ] **Assess impact** - how many users/services affected?
- [ ] **Classify severity** using the table above
- [ ] **Start timer** for response time tracking
- [ ] **Create incident ticket** in GitHub Issues

### Investigation Phase (5-15 minutes)

- [ ] **Check service dependencies** - are related services affected?
- [ ] **Review recent deployments** - any recent changes?
- [ ] **Check infrastructure status** - servers, databases, networks
- [ ] **Examine application logs** for error patterns
- [ ] **Monitor key metrics** - CPU, memory, response times
- [ ] **Test service endpoints** manually

### Communication Phase (Within first 15 minutes)

- [ ] **Notify stakeholders** based on severity level
- [ ] **Update status page** with initial incident report
- [ ] **Send internal alerts** to relevant team members
- [ ] **Prepare customer communication** if customer-facing

## üîç Investigation Procedures

### Backend Production Issues

1. **Check API Health Endpoints**

   - Network connectivity
   - Load balancer status

### SaaS Platform Issues

1. **User Experience Testing**
   - Test login functionality
   - Check core user workflows
   - Verify data loading and saving

2. **Frontend Monitoring**
